Spring Petklinik is a Kotlin fullstack variant of the typical [Spring Petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) example with Kotlin/Wasm for the frontend instead of JavaScript or TypeScript.

This project leverages [Kotlin multiplatform support](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) to share code between Wasm and JVM using a shared module.

To run the application, use `./gradlew bootRun` and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
